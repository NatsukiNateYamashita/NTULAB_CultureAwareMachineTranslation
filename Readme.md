# Culture-Aware Machine Translation

## Purpose
Reduce the problem caused by cultural differences in cross-cultural communication.

## Back Grounds
The different language uses in a certain culture for relevant situations has negative impacts on the relationships among the people in conversation.
It leads to misunderstandings, communication breakdowns, and so on.
e.g. make others recognize you as bad personality, no manner, or no Ã©tiquette.

Machine translators, which will be used more and more in daily life, should alleviate this problem.

## Goals
+ Find how different the "appropriate" language uses in relevant situations in Japanese and Chinese culture are.
+ Verify that the Seq2seq model can be aware of the "appropriate" language uses in relevant situations.
+ Verify that we can have the Seq2seq model generate translations with more "appropriate" language uses in relevant situations.

## What we did
+ Create Parallel Dataset in Dialogue
+ Statistical Analysis
+ Situation Classification
+ Culture-Aware Translation
